1.	Did you retest anything that was tested in the Pilot, but with a slight variation (and what was the outcome)?
2.	Did you test any gaps in what was tested in the Pilot (and what was the outcome)?
3.	Did you test any extensions to the Pilot Spec?
4.	Did you test anything in cooperation with another participant?
5.	In cases where the Pilot Spec was defective or confusing, contained a gap, or needs to be extended, did you document your findings so that a Change Request can be written against the Pilot Spec?
6.	Did you conduct any performance testing to gain insight into what bottlenecks might hinder scalability?
7.	Other testing that doesnâ€™t fall into any of these categories?
