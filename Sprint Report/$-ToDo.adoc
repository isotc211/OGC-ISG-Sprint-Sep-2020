* *Participant reports*
** Review for content
** All Participants (all changes via PR to master)
*** Use "Sprint"
*** Cognitics
**** Review all images captions
*** Helyx
**** Link to SwaggerHub for draft spec. Should be changed to OGC ER
**** Is it "3d" or "3D" Tiles?
**** Generate captions for all images
*** InfoDao
**** Comment near end for "Insert image here" removed
**** Use "glTF". Need to check on "GLB"
*** SimBlocks.io
**** Please clarify the 2nd paragraph at https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-SimBlocks.adoc#server-testing. Providing examples would be good. You are highlighting an inconsistency in operation that should be cleared up.
**** Need to provide proper link to TIE Table in Findings section (tbd)

* *Findings*
** No defects were uncovered in the GeoVolumes draft spec
** Used a previously OGC-unused CDB with success
** Successul demonstration of multiple participants server resources
** CAE
*** Use AWS for service hosting
*** Dragonfly (Cognitics) rendering was too dark & required manual lighting for region
*** Full Motion Video object generation worked, but required manual placement in scene
** Cesium
*** On-the-fly CDB to glTF converter requires more effort
*** Mismatch in resolution between elecation and imagery (terrain covering) led to gaps in data or duplicated data
*** High-detail building files are very large (50-100MB). Need to improve tiling scheme (reduce tile sizes) to maintain/increase rendering performance.
*** More convergence needed for implicit tiling schemes, raster layers, and per-texel metadata.
** Helyx
*** _Need to read in more depth. Most of the discussion is about alternate datasets and how they should be accessed._
** Hexagon
*** CDB recommendations (https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-Hexagon.adoc#cdb-technical-specification-recommendations)
*** Generated model CRUD using on-the-fly approach
*** Handled terrain updates with proxy server to adjust model elevations
** InfoDao
*** Ease of accessing 3D Tiles data via GeoVolumes API.
*** Agree with issues raised by Helyx regarding data structure and alternate datasets
*** CDB is not interperted on server. Major work for client
*** CDB internal data format is not known to the client until it arrives
** SimBlocks.io
*** Found inconsistencies between the various servers (https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-SimBlocks.adoc#server-testing) and 
*** Imported glTF and 3D Tiles into Unity using a mix of custom and licensed solutions
** Steinbeis
*** Able to use GeoVOlumes and SensorThings APIs to produce a working emulation demo
*** Examined two cases for storage of #D & terrain data: all in one & by feature type
*** Conversion from CDB (data-store format) to 3D Tiles (rendering format) is complex and time-consuming
*** Able to add or delete structures



* *Futures*
** Updates for glTF
** Extract and summarize particpants
** CAE (https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-CAE.adoc#recommendations)
*** Dealing with data disparity issues between CDB, 3D Tiles, and glTF
*** Batch converter from CDB models to glTF
*** Handling geoposition information for glTF
** Cesium
*** Rendering performance can be improved if multiple 3D models are combined into a single OpenFlight file
** Cognitics
** Hexagon
*** On the fly tiling of CDB to eliminate need to pre-process CDB to 3D Tiles and provide a better solution to data-store updates
** InfoDao
*** Further investigation is necessary along lines of Helyx's and Ecere's comments.
** SimBlocks.io
*** Improve Unity loading of content (glTF, 3D Tiles)
*** Additional investigation of GeoVolumes bounding volume queries
** Steinbeis
*** New API for "Feature Transaction" that covers updates to scenes when features within a scene undergo an update. [Note: Other participants indicate that this needs to include terrain updates.]
*** Batch conversion of CDB to 3D Tiles. 
*** GeoVolumes may need a bounding box with a hole as described in https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-Steinbeis.adoc#1-3d-geovolumes-api-query---polygon-with-a-hole
*** Potential inconsistency in naming conventions when looking at resolutions finer than region. See https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-Steinbeis.adoc#2-3d-geovolumes-api-organization-different-semantic-parts
