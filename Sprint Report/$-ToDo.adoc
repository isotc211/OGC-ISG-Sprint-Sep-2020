=== *Findings*
* No defects were uncovered in the GeoVolumes draft spec
* Some inconsistencies were discovered
* Used a previously OGC-unused CDB with success
* Successul demonstration of multiple participants server resources
* *CAE*
** 3-participant team: CAE, Cesium, Cognitics
** Use AWS for service hosting
** Dragonfly (Cognitics) rendering was too dark & required manual lighting for region
** Full Motion Video object generation worked, but required manual placement in scene
* *Cesium*
** 3-participant team: CAE, Cesium, Cognitics
** On-the-fly CDB to glTF converter requires more effort
** Mismatch in resolution between elecation and imagery (terrain covering) led to gaps in data or duplicated data
** High-detail building files are very large (50-100MB). Need to improve tiling scheme (reduce tile sizes) to maintain/increase rendering performance.
** More convergence needed for implicit tiling schemes, raster layers, and per-texel metadata.
* *Cognitics*
** 3-participant team: CAE, Cesium, Cognitics
** Deployed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Docker containers
** Displays 3D content according to current bounding box
** Domenstrated access to other data sources not part of Sprint
* *Ecere*
** Teamed with Steinbeis to inverstigate 3D model create/update & delete using _OGC API - Features_
** Unknown issue with 3D model placement on terrain surface
** Proposed extenson for 3D Models referencing
** Possible inconsistency between bounding box label between GeoVolumes and Common (bbox vs. subset)
* *Helyx*
** Investigated alternate distribtion 
** Following issues should be investigated prior to ratifying a GeoVolumes API
*** CDB could be treated as a media type
*** JSON reponse to an endpoint request for CDB could be used to describe the data structure
** The boundry between different OGC APIs is not always clear or hard. This is not a particular problem if all APIs consistently follow OpenAPI Common as a core.
** Not clear how to represent alternate distributions - URL path or search parameters. This needs further resolution.
** Potential issue with the use of '/' and ':' in specifying the collectionId
* *Hexagon*
** CDB recommendations (https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-Hexagon.adoc#cdb-technical-specification-recommendations)
** Generated model CRUD using on-the-fly approach
** Handled terrain updates with proxy server to adjust model elevations
* *InfoDao*
** Ease of accessing 3D Tiles data via GeoVolumes API.
** Agree with issues raised by Helyx regarding data structure and alternate datasets
** CDB is not interperted on server. Major work for client
** CDB internal data format is not known to the client until it arrives
* *SimBlocks.io*
** Found inconsistencies between the various servers (https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-SimBlocks.adoc#server-testing) and 
** Imported glTF and 3D Tiles into Unity using a mix of custom and licensed solutions
* *Steinbeis*
** Teamed with Ecere to inverstigate 3D model CRUD using _OGC API - Features_
** Able to use GeoVolumes and SensorThings APIs to produce a working emulation demo
** Examined two cases for storage of #D & terrain data: all in one & by feature type
** Conversion from CDB (data-store format) to 3D Tiles (rendering format) is complex and time-consuming
** Able to add or delete structures



=== *Futures*
* Updates for glTF
* Extract and summarize particpants
* *CAE* (https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-CAE.adoc#recommendations)
** Dealing with data disparity issues between CDB, 3D Tiles, and glTF
** Batch converter from CDB models to glTF
** Handling geoposition information for glTF
* *Cesium*
** Rendering performance can be improved if multiple 3D models are combined into a single OpenFlight file
* *Cognitics*
** _none stated_
* *Ecere*
** Improve (optimize) 3D Tiles tileset generation
** Implement change/update transactions, including change history
** _Note: there seems to be some confusion between the HTTP PUT and HTTP Patch request methods. The example shown in Figures 29&30 could be better done with a *Patch* request._
** Registration of non-experimental, non-vendor media types (also Helyx)
** Need to better define and name API to reflect what it actually does and delivers
* *Helyx*
** Improved understanding and definition of the system of OGC API systems so that there is spec-level consistency to the request URI when accessing resources across the various implementations of OGC APIs.
* *Hexagon*
** On the fly tiling of CDB to eliminate need to pre-process CDB to 3D Tiles and provide a better solution to data-store updates
* *InfoDao*
** Further investigation is necessary along lines of Helyx's and Ecere's comments.
* *SimBlocks.io*
** Improve Unity loading of content (glTF, 3D Tiles)
** Additional investigation of GeoVolumes bounding volume queries
* *Steinbeis*
** New API for "Feature Transaction" that covers updates to scenes when features within a scene undergo an update. [Note: Other participants indicate that this needs to include terrain updates.]
** Batch conversion of CDB to 3D Tiles. 
** GeoVolumes may need a bounding box with a hole as described in https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-Steinbeis.adoc#1-3d-geovolumes-api-query---polygon-with-a-hole
** Potential inconsistency in naming conventions when looking at resolutions finer than region. See https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-ISG-Sprint-Sep-2020/blob/master/Sprint%20Report/7-Steinbeis.adoc#2-3d-geovolumes-api-organization-different-semantic-parts
