= Technology Integration Experiment (TIE) Table

*Introduction*

The Pilot started tracking the ability of a client from one participant to correctly access the server from another. This data was collected into a Technology Integration Experiment (TIE) Table to easily illustrate the extent of cross-organzation integration. A summary version of this table is presented in <<table-tie>> below.

[#table-tie,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.The full Technology Integration Experiment data. This table shows how each participant has integrated with other participants. It was not a requirement that all participants be fully integrated with each other.

*TIE Report: Hexagon*

.*Hexagon-Cesium*
20.10.06::

* New York : good.
* Sidney: The glTF data is missing a primitive Type which in this case would be “triangles”. This might be a problem on both sides as “triangles” is generally the default. But in the glTF 2.0 spec, this parameter is not shown as being optional:
** “Each mesh primitive has a rendering mode, which is a constant indicating whether it should be rendered as POINTS, LINES, or TRIANGLES."
* Waratah Station: stuck at decoding the tileset.json.
* Note: the problems are with the 3DTiles tilesets, not with the GeoVolumes API.

.*Hexagon-Steinbeis New*
20.10.06:: Problem with absolute references in tileset.json files (expected relative) which might be a problem in the Hexagon client.

*TIE Report: InfoDao*

.*InfoDao-Cesium*

.*SimBlocks-Ecere*
20.09.24::
* Issues:
** Conformance and Api are Unsupported.
** Uri json values contain strings referencing b3dm files. In this case, the Uri values are relative to the domain. For all other servers, the Uri value is relative to the current page Url.
