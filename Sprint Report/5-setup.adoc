=== Call for Participation

The "ISG Sprint: Call for Participation (CfP)" [^1] was released on 7 July 2020 by Open Geospatial Consortium for the purpose of obtaining proposals from organizations interested in furthering study of the GeoVolumes draft specification [^2b]. The CfP provided all of the material necessary for organizations to make a proposal for participation either by direct inclusion in the document or publicly available links.

The CfP specified a schedule from kick off meeting (1 September) through the Sprint Week (21-25 September), and final report (5 October). The Sprint was originally desired to be in-person; however, the epidemic required that all work be done in the participants own facilities during the alloted week. This decision was made prior to the due date for proposals.

=== Data Sets

The primary data set for the Sprint is known as San Diego CDB. It was collected using a number of sensors and methods from <start> to <end> and encompased nearly all of the downtown San Diego and vacinity, including the port, sports stadium, recreational facilities, commercial, and housing areas.

All participants could elect to use other datasets, particularly any of those from the OGC 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot (aka Pilot) [^2abc]. In particular much use was made of the New York data set.

The San Diego CDB was available for download by all participants. The Pilot Net York data was available through multiple servers built during the Pilot using the API from the Pilot.

== 3D GeoVolume Servers

Several of the Sprint participants also participated in the Pilot. These organizations provided their GeoVolumes API servers for use to everyone during the Sprint. These servers were generally populated with both the New York and San Diego data.

=== GeoVolume API Pilot Engineering Report

The entirity of the 3D Data Container and Tiles API Pilot engineering report (aka Pilot ER)[^2abc] was made available to all participants prior to the kick off meeting. Subsequent to the start of the Sprint, the Pilot ER was made publicly available. The draft specification is part 2 [^2b] of the document set. This is the API specification that is the primary target of the Sprint.

=== Architecture diagrams
